# Roulette - Intro to Python Final Project 
## by Sid Sadel
This program is a simulation of European roulette. One bet can be placed, and if the bet hits, the according winnings - based on the amount bet and odds - are added to
the users balance. I wasn't able to complete everything I wanted to in the time I had. I wanted to create an interactive image where any bet can be placed by clicking on an image. While I didn't accomplish that, I did accomplish one interactive button using tkinter, so that is a success to me. I believe if I had more time I could have completed it. One struggle I had was reading the sheer quantity of code I wrote. It got confusing and overwhelming at times which is probably due to not having taking a structures class yet. 

The program is under finalProj
