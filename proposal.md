# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Roulette

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive roulette wheel that lets you place bets and will show the odds and return based off that bet. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be interactive and have to highlight the bet which the mouse is hovered over, and be able to place a chip on the certain bet. I will need to import images and figure out how to loosely animate the ball spinning. I need to figure out how to utilize the mouse position in relation to a coordinate grid of images in order to place bets. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will definitely have a program that at least prompts a user for an input bet amount and what bet to take on the spread. It will return the odds of that bet and the return amount made. The total balance, and profit/loss from that round will be displayed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to the previous answer, an interactive visual that is also animated is ideal. 
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A complete interactive roulette wheel that over the course of multiple spins will show hot and cold numbers as well as other various statistics. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to utilize images and make them interactive. I assume this cannot be done in IDLE alone. I need to figure out how to map the images as a coordinate grid, and utilize my mouse positioning to select certain bets. All the other skills I know how to do, such as randomly generating the outcome and calculating various statistics about the spins.
