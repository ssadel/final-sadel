Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created a program that takes a single number bet and a bet amount and randomly spins a number 0-36, and if that number hits the winnings are added to the players balance. If it is a loss, the winnings are subtracted. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Created interactive visual, and allocated for other types of bets besides straight bets

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It’s a lot of code and it gets overwhelming at times.
