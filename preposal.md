# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to create some sort of recreation of either roulette, or a game of classic Texas hold-em poker. IÕd like to somehow create an interactive visual which a user clicks on the path he/she would like to take. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Potentially will work with Tyler Grenell

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Can a project be created with two languages, and how would that work? Also, how would I create a visual?
